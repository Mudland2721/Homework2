          <!--Opening-->
          My name is Mason and this is my about me page I made for myself in my
          Coding Bootcamp. In here you will find a brief description about
          myself and what it is I am. I am a huge gamer and have been for quite
          sometime. The Witcher is one of my favorites thus far. It is a
          fantastic book with a stellar story and it transitioned very well in
          the Witcher 3. Would recommend to all if you have some free time. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <!--Music-->
          I am
          very into music a day does not go by when I don't listen to at least
          six or seven songs. One of my favorite bands is Tool. The way Maynard
          James Keenan (Lead singer) and Adam Thomas Jones (Lead Guitarist)
          synergize on record not only appeal to the ear but appeal to a sense
          of musical progression that not many other groups have.
          <br>
          <br>
          <!--BMW-->
          I am a fan of
          cars and am a amateur mechanic. One of my favorite brand of vehicles
          is BMW. They look and handle vey well and they make for great daily
          drivers and race cars. My favorite BMW to date is the BMW E39 M5. Very
          powerful V8 engine when they were produced the manual transmissions
          were given a bit more horse power under the hood than the automatics.
          <br>

          <!--Coding-->
          Currently I am learning how to become a Developer and am still a rookie
          but not to worry this isn't my final form. Given time and effort I will
          be devolving as a profession. Please look through out my page here and
          should you need to contact me please click on the "contact" section. If you would like to view my portfolio please be my guest. Hope to speak to you soon.
